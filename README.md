This is the item system for my upcoming game "Salt VS Pepper" on Steam.

It's made for adding new items such as guns (shootable) and walls (placeable) very easy.

You add a new item to the Items enum, and create a new class "ItemX" that inherits the default Item class, and only change the necessary parts.

By default, it automatically handles "shootable" and "placeable" items' functions without changing anything else.
